    title: "Club Bun",
    desc: `As you approach the most exclusive spot in town, Club Bun, the air hums with anticipation. While you must make a reservation months ahead to get in, the wait is worth it. It’s easy to hear the excitement beyond the club’s front doors—distant laughter perks your mood, glasses click, and people shout for more shots. Neon signs bathe the street below, illuminating a path to this nocturnal sanctuary.
      <br/><br/> The entrance to the bar opens up to a brilliant display of light and sound. A space for live music is tucked into the back corner of the wall, ready for the next performance by the resident musician—a bunny man who lives above the club. A long bar sits along the wall, as do cushy booths around the illuminated dance floor. Intoxicating melodies intertwine with the murmur of conversation, blending seamlessly to form a symphony of nightlife.
      <br/><br/> Ascending a discreet staircase, one would find the most exclusive part of the club — the penthouse, where the illustrious bunny man resides. The penthouse’s windows offer a panoramic view of the city’s sparkling skyline, a tapestry of skyscrapers and low-rise buildings, and the best view of Stardust City.`,

      <br/> And massive profits! <br/> The payout allowed Buff to buy a skyscraper in the Skyline District, where the pups can do all of their corpa things, like play with papers and drink coffee. Buff isn't exactly sure what happens within the building. There’s an arrow that’s sometimes green and sometimes red. That’s about as much as she’s gleaned from the screen in her office, but she’ll get back to you on it.`,

    title: "Silver Creek",
    desc: `Silver Creek is a suburban development settled beside the creek it was named for. Rows of charming houses with well-manicured lawns line the peaceful streets, each neatly matched with the one next to it. Beautiful flowers pepper the yards, and children play in the streets. If asked to pick out a house from the rest, one would struggle to decide—until a loud explosion or a distinct cloud of smoke emerges from one particular garage.
      <br/>Tucked between the cookie-cutter homes stands a house—much like the rest—only remarkable if a mistake is made. It is the hackneyed home base of an unhinged scientist, externally unremarkable but filled to the brim with out-of-this-world technology. The space has been transformed into a laboratory.`,

If you pry, the cat girl will promise she only works there, though it’s hard to believe her as she always winks as she says it.
      <br/>Once inside the arcade, the atmosphere transforms into decadence and bright lights. Rows of arcade cabinets, their glowing screens offering a kaleidoscope of scores and buttons to toy with. Crane machines stand along every exposed space, and gachapon machines are in every corner. Little honeybuns tend to the machines, eager to ensure everyone has the best time possible.`,

      <br/>Regardless, Candii moved to an abandoned facility in Blackthorn Mire, where an alternate version of themselves had previously run. It's a long story, with portals and everything. Just know that Candii dimension-hopped, and that's something they can do. Great. Get out of this file section; I'm sure it's too much for you to understand.`,

Whispers of ancient folklore feel real now as the stories of werewolves rise within the mind. The occasional hoot of an owl or the rustle of a small creature scurrying through the underbrush only adds to the place’s mystique.
      <br/>Shadows elongate and intertwine, the distant flashes of orange and tan caught between the dense brush. The glint of blue behind a tree’s silhouette, claws drawn along fallen logs. A mischievous little laugh catches your ear, an invitation to play — or to run.`,

But then rosedoodle became sick, despite the best efforts of their owner. They tried everything to take care of their darling cat, to see her play and enjoy herself again. Rosedoodle tried her best until the very end to keep a smile on their owner's face.
      <br/>After saying goodbye to rosedoodle as she passed away in their home, they sought to bury her in the nicest place they could think of. However, when her owner placed the much-beloved cat into its final resting place, they left, thinking she would remain there forever. No one would suspect this was the beginning of Rose's next life.
      <br/>Thanks to a combination of a bubbly pink flower and a Honeybun named Beepu, rosedoodle returned from her grave a newly formed cat sprout, partially human, partially cat, all parasitic—erm, all cute, that is. While Rose no longer lives at the pet cemetery, she took one of the flowers with her to help spread joy in Stardust City.`,

In time, she created a beautiful nook to call her own, with a bed, a computer, and cute trinkets. She also got a sick jacket, which she may have left at Candii’s lab.",
