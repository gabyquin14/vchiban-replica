              VchiBan is passionate about creating premier experiences for
              conventions. We aim to provide exciting content to all attendees
              while connecting with our community. We do this through several
              methods; panels, meet and greets, and signings.
            </p>
            <p>
              We specialize in panels that emphasize crowd engagement, such as
              Q&A sessions. We love to share our experiences, insights, and
              stories from the VTubing world. We also talk about Vtubing in a
              broad sense, as well as how we grew within the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, we offer advice panels, providing guidance and
              sharing our expertise on various topics related to VTubing,
              content creation, and online communities.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of our specialties is meet and greets, done via a screen. We
              can actively interact with attendees via webcam and microphone,
              creating an eye-catching attraction that stops people in their
              tracks. We love getting to know everyone, taking photos, and
              signing autographs. We pride ourselves on creating a welcoming,
              inclusive environment that encourages even the shyest people to
              open up.
