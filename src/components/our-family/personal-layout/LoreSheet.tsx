          After so much hard work in the corporate offices (and some untimely
          investment by the Pups), our beloved Buffpup has decided to get back
          to her roots. Sure, some might say she &quot;lost&quot; the keys to
          the skyscraper, but you can&apos;t prove that. Anyway, this tent is
          sick! Check it out. Everything a werewolf could need is in this little
          camp ground. Friends, fun, movies, food, no one could want anything
          more. Also, don&apos;t touch the sleeping bag. We don&apos;t know
          who&apos;s in there right now, but they&apos;re probably asleep. (And
          possibly stuck in there.)
